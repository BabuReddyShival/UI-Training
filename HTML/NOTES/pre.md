# Pre

* In general in HTML new lines and spaces are not considered while rendering the webpage

* To preserve those white spaces and new lines, we should use <pre> tag.

* In any other tag, extra spaces or lines between start tag and end tag are not considered. But in Pre tag, each space or new line are considered.
