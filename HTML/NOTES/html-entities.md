# HTML Entities

* Some special characters like <, >, space, &, copyright, currency symbols are not directly available in html

* We have to use HTML entities to render these symbols on the webpage

* Although some symbols like < or > can used directly, it can cause confusion when followed by text like div

example: <div ====>  &lt;div

* Space is the most important HTML entity, because more than one spaces are not considered by browser while rendering

* Every special character is represented by an HTML entity and each entity will have 2 representations.

    1. Entity Name
    2. Entity Number

For example: space ==> &nbsp;  ==> &#160;
