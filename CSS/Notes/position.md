# Position

* Position CSS attribute will change the position of where to show the element apart from its actual position.

* Different values for position are:
    1. static (non positioned element)
    2. relative
    3. absolute
    4. fixed
    5. sticky

* 'Static' position is same as no position

Note: any other position apart from static, we should use top, left, right, bottom along with 'position' property.

* 'relative' position is positioning the element relative to its position in the parent.

* 'absolute' position is positioning the element relative to nearest positioned element or the body.

* 'fixed' position is positioning the element relative to view-port.

example: chat windows that come at the bottom of the page. which will not scroll even if page scrolls.

Note: we might position an element in same place using position absolute and fixed. But difference is, fixed element will not scroll, whereas the abolsute element will scroll along with the page.

* 'sticky' position is positioning the element at a specific place on scroll.

example: navigation bar getting sticked to the top of the screen on scroll.
